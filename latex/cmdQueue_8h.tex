Header file for \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{classcmdQueue}{cmd\+Queue}}\textquotesingle{} (Command Queue) class. This class is based on \textquotesingle{}mts\+Queue\textquotesingle{} of the CISST library which is a queue that can be accessed in a thread-\/safe manner, assuming that there is only one reader and one writer and that pointer updates are atomic. Thus only one thread should call \textquotesingle{}Get\textquotesingle{} and one thread should call \textquotesingle{}Put\textquotesingle{} and one cmd\+Que is needed for each connection between the components. This queue is used to implement \textquotesingle{}Mail\+Box\textquotesingle{} of each software component where the commands and events are queued Created \+: 2022.\+07.\+06 Chunwoo Kim (CKim) Last Updated \+: 2022.\+07.\+06 Chunwoo Kim (CKim) Contact Info \+: \href{mailto:cwkim@kist.re.kr}{\texttt{ cwkim@kist.\+re.\+kr}}.
